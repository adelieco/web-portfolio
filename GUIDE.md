Web Portfolio: Guide
---

Read this quick guide for tips, brainstorming prompts, etc. 

Refer to the [Project One Prompt](http://notes.adelie.co/s/rJNJFoc_e) for specifics. 

Feel free to write in this file and mess it up - that's why it's here!

## First, the concrete stuff.

`index.html` will be your home page HTML file. Write your HTML there.
`css/style.css` is your main CSS stylesheet. Write your CSS there.
`assets` is a blank folder for your assets, such as images or fonts you may wish to include. Put your assets here, and figure out how to link them.

That's all! Use the Project Prompt and the rest of this guide for tips with the project!

## Developing Content
Content comes in the form of text, audio, video, and photos. However, text will always be your weapon-of-choice on the web. Refer to the Project Prompt and think about what kind of text you'll need to produce.

**TIP**: For images, it's optional, but a nice photo of yourself goes a long way.<br/>
**TIP**: Audio and video are usually not necessary for these kinds of sites.

## Building a Personal Brand`
Branding is an entire subject on its own, but for now, let's keep it very simple.

What mood are you going for with your site? How are you trying to represent yourself, and to what audience?
- feminine, masculine, neutral?
- casual, serious?
- verbose, terse?
- informal, formal?
- nontechnical, technical?
- colorful, monotone?

**TIP**: For a web portfolio, our audience is generally going to be the same: potential employers, professional connections, and coworkers. Keep this in mind as you proceed.

## Using Photos Well

A picture is worth a thousand words. Use photos to add personality and color to your site.

There are tons of free image repositories available online. Peruse some of them to find great images for your site. Or, if your phone is capable, try snapping a beautiful photo yourself!

**TIP**: Using too many photos as part of your main layout is a beginner mistake. Use it in moderation.

## Fonts are like accents but for text.

[Google Webfonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is an insanely popular choice for getting free, web-optimized fonts. They have a beautiful selection!

**TIP**: One font for paragraphs, one font for headings. Maybe one more for special purposes. That's it. If you feel the urge to spice up your design with more fonts, it's an indication that your design is lacking elsewhere.

## Don't Be Afraid To Copy

There is this idea that copying other websites is somehow creatively dishonest. This is only true if you copy it exactly and claim that it's your work. Don't be afraid to draw inspiration from tons of sources, whether its other sites, business cards, billboards, anything! After all: 

> Good artists copy, great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso

## Ask and ye shall receive!

We can't help you if you don't ask for it. Do your best to read manuals, scour documentation, and google the crap out of things, but if you can't solve it on your own - ask.
